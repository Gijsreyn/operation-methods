# Desired State Configuration RFC

This folder contains RFC documents for community feedback on proposed changes and improvements

See [RFC0000: RFC-Process][01] for process information.

Along with making DSC open source, we're also inviting the community to author RFCs on proposed
design changes (instead of having long threads in issues). The DSC team will meet at least once per
month (more frequently, depending on amount of feedback) to review and respond.

We'll continue to refine this process as we learn from it.

## RFC History

The following table shows the RFCs that have been reviewed and processed by the committee. It
doesn't include draft RFCs.

<!--
    After an RFC PR is merged or closed, a maintainer should update this table to include a new
    entry for the RFC. You can use the `rfc-table-entry` snippet in VS Code to create the new
    entry.

    Use the pull requests column to link to the associated PR for the RFC. You can use the autolink
    functionality and reference the pull request by number, like `#123`.

    For RFCs in the accepted, experimental, or final state, update the entry in the RFC column to
    point to the merged document.
