title: dsc resource get result (simple)
description: >-
  Describes the return data for a single DSC resource instance from the
  `dsc resource get` command. This data is returned for instances that aren't
  group resources, adapter resources, or nested inside a group or adapter
  resource.

  When you use `dsc resource get` for a group or adapter resource, the command
  returns an array of full test result objects that include the name and
  type for the nested instances.
