  DSC extensions always have at least one capability. Extension capabilities define the operations
  DSC can invoke for an extension and how the extension behaves when invoked.

      An extension with the `discover` capability supports retrieving the path to DSC resource
      manifests that aren't included in the `PATH` or `DSC_RESOURCE_PATH`, like manifests for
      software installed as AppX packages.

      An extension has this capability when its manifest defines the [discover][02]
      property.
