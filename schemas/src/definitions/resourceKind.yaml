  [_Online Documentation_][01]

  Defines how DSC should interpret the resource - as a typical resource, an adapter, a group, or an
  importer. This property is required for group, exporter, and importer resources.

  DSC infers the default value for this property based on whether the [adapter][02] property is
  defined in the manifest:

  - If the `adapter` property is defined in the manifest, the default `kind` is `adapter`.
  - If the `adapter` property is not defined in the manifest, the default `kind` is `resource`.

  For more information about the different kinds of DSC resources, see [DSC resource kinds][01]

markdownEnumDescriptions:
  - | # resource
      <!-- force a line break -->

      Indicates that the manifest is for a typical DSC command resource.
  - | # adapter
      <!-- force a line break -->

      Indicates that the manifest is for a resource that enables the use of non-command resources
      with DSC.
  - | # group
      <!-- force a line break -->

      Indicates that the manifest is for a resource that processes an array of nested resource
      instances.
  - | # importer
      <!-- force a line break -->

      Indicates that the manifest is for a resource that resolves an external source to DSC
      resource instances. DSC processes the resolved instances as nested instances for the importer
      resource.
  - | # exporter
      <!-- force a line break -->

      Indicates that the manifest is for a resource that only implements the **Export** operation
      to use for inventory and fact-gathering scenarios. For exporter resources, DSC expects the
      resource to return one or more resource definitions to recursively export, rather than the
      actual state of instances.

      For more information about the expected output, see [Export resource operation stdout][02].
