  Represents the full path a DSC resource manifest. DSC expects every JSON Line
  emitted to stdout for the **Discover** operation to adhere to this schema. An extension indicates
  that it supports the **Discover** operation by defining the [discover][01] field in its manifest.

  The output must be a JSON object.

      Defines the absolute path to a DSC resource manifest on the system. DSC expects this value to
      be the absolute path to a manifest file that exists. If this value is a relative path, or if
      the manifest doesn't exist, DSC raises an error.
