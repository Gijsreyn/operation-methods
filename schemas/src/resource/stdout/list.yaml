  Defines the representation of an adapted resource in DSC. DSC expects every JSON Line emitted to
  stdout for the **List** operation to adhere to this schema.

  DSC includes the following adapter resources:

  - `Microsoft.DSC/PowerShell` run PowerShell and enables you to use PowerShell DSC (PSDSC)
    resources implemented as PowerShell classes in DSC.
  - `Microsoft.Windows/WindowsPowerShell` runs Windows PowerShell and enables you to use any
    available PSDSC resources in DSC. This adapter is only available when you install DSC on
    Windows.
  - `Microsoft.Windows/WMI` enables you to use WMI classes as resources in DSC. This adapter is
    only available when you install DSC on Windows.
