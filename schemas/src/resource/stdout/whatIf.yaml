  Defines the JSON DSC expects a resource to emit to stdout for the **Set** operation in what-if
  mode.

  DSC expects different output from the command resource depending on the definition of
  [whatIf.return][01] in the resource manifest:
  
  - If the field is defined as `state`, DSC expects the resource to emit a JSON Line to stdout
    representing the actual state of the resource instance after the **Set** operation changes the
    system.
  - If the field is defined as `stateAndDiff`, DSC expects the resource to emit two JSON Lines. The
    first JSON Line should be an object representing the actual state of the resource after the
    **Set** operation. The second JSON Line should be an array representing the names of the
    resource properties that the operation changed on the system.

      When a resource defines `whatIf.return` in its manifest as `state` or `stateAndDiff`, DSC
      expects the resource to emit a JSON Line to stdout representing the predicted actual state of
      the resource instance after the **Set** operation changes the system.

      When a command resource defines [whatIf.return][01] in its manifest as `state` or
      `stateAndDiff`, DSC expects the resource to emit a JSON Line to stdout representing the
      expected actual state of the resource instance after the **Set** operation changes the
      system.

      The output must be a JSON object. The object must be a valid representation of an instance of
      the resource.

      Command resources define their instance schema with the [schema.command][02] or
      [schema.embedded][03] fields in their resource manifest. If a command resource returns JSON
      that is invalid against the resource instance schema, DSC raises an error.

      Adapted resource instances are validated by their adapter when the adapter invokes them.

      This output must be emitted after the JSON Line representing the state of the resource
      instance after the operation changes the system.

      The output must be a JSON array. The array may be empty, or it may contain one or more
      strings. Each string in the array must be the name of one of the resource's properties. Each
      string in the array must be unique.
