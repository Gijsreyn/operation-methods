  Represents the actual state of a resource instance in DSC. DSC expects the JSON Line emitted to
  stdout for the **Get** operation to adhere to this schema.

  The output must be a JSON object. The object must be a valid representation of an instance of the
  resource.

  Command resources define their instance schema with the [schema.command][01] or
  [schema.embedded][02] fields in their resource manifest. If a command resource returns JSON that
  is invalid against the resource instance schema, DSC raises an error.

  Adapted resource instances are validated by their adapter when the adapter invokes them.
