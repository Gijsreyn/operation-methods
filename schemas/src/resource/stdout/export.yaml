  DSC expects a resource implementing the **Export** operation to return a series of JSON Lines.

  The data that DSC expects depends on whether the resource kind is defined as `exporter`:

  - When the resource kind is `exporter`, DSC expects the resource to return JSON Lines
    representing DSC resource instance definitions to recursively export.
  - When the resource kind isn't `exporter`, DSC expects the resource to return JSON Lines
    representing the actual state of every instance of the resource on the system.

      DSC expects a typical resource implementing the **Export** operation to return a series of
      JSON Lines.

      Each JSON Line represents the actual state of a resource instance in DSC. DSC expects every
      JSON Line emitted to stdout for the **Export** operation to adhere to this schema.

      The output must be a JSON object. The object must be a valid representation of an instance of
      the resource.

      Command resources define their instance schema with the [schema.command][01] or
      [schema.embedded][02] fields in their resource manifest. If a command resource returns JSON that
      is invalid against the resource instance schema, DSC raises an error.

      Adapted resource instances are validated by their adapter when the adapter invokes them.

      DSC expects an exporter resource (one with the `kind` field in its manifest set to
      `exporter`) to return a series of JSON Lines.

      Each JSON Line represents a DSC resource instance definition to recursively invoke the
      **Export** operation for. DSC expects every JSON Line emitted to stdout for the **Export**
      operation to adhere to this schema.

      The output must be a JSON object adhering to [DSC resource instance][01] schema, rather than
      the instance schema for a specific resource. DSC expects the object to define at least the
      [name][02] and [type][03] fields. If the object defines the [properties][04] field, DSC
      passes those properties to the resource when recursively exporting it so that the resource
      may filter the exported instance results.
