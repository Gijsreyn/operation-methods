  Defines how DSC must call the DSC extension to discover the paths to resource manifests. An
  extension that defines this field in its manifest has the `discover` capability.
  
  By default, DSC only discovers resource manifests in the `PATH` environment variable. If the
  `DSC_RESOURCE_PATH` environment variable is defined, DSC searches those paths for resource
  manifests instead.

  If initial discovery finds any extension manifests that have the `discover` capability, DSC uses
  those extensions to discover resources that aren't available in `PATH` or `DSC_RESOURCE_PATH`.

  For more information about the output DSC expects the extension to emit for this command, see
  [Discover extension operation stdout][01].

      Defines the name of the command to run. The value must be the name of a command discoverable
      in the system's `PATH` environment variable or the full path to the command. A file extension
      is only required when the command isn't recognizable by the operating system as an
      executable.

      Defines an array of strings to pass as arguments to the command. DSC passes the arguments to
      the command in the order they're specified.

      For example, the given the following definition:

      ```json
      {
        "executable": "myextension",
        "args":       ["discover", "--all"],
      }
      ```

      DSC invokes the command for the resource as:

      ```bash
      myextension discover --all
      ```
