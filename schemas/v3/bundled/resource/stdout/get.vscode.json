DSC expects the JSON Line emitted to\nstdout for the **Get** operation to adhere to this schema.\n\nThe output must be a JSON object. The object must be a valid representation of an instance of the\nresource.\n\nCommand resources define their instance schema with the [schema.command][01] or\n[schema.embedded][02] fields in their resource manifest. If a command resource returns JSON that\nis invalid against the resource instance schema, DSC raises an error.\n\nAdapted resource instances are validated by their adapter when the adapter invokes them.\n\n[00]: https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/dsc/reference/schemas/resource/stdout/get?view=dsc-3.0&preserve-view=true\n[01]: https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/dsc/reference/schemas/resource/manifest/schema/command?view=dsc-3.0&preserve-view=true\n[02]: https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/dsc/reference/schemas/resource/manifest/schema/embedded?view=dsc-3.0&preserve-view=true\n",
